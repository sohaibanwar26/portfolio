### [Sky Detection Algorithm to aid UAV navigation](https://github.com/sohaibanwar26/ScalaCovidApp)

UAV should be equipped with an efficient autonomous obstacle avoidance system. 
In this paper, we are going to introduce an efficient approach for sky segmentation in a cluttered environment that is considered as a vital step for UAV autonomous obstacle avoidance. 
From experimental results, the proposed sky segmentation approach gives promising results for significantly sky segmentation and preserving the potential obstacles.
