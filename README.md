### Pain Intensity Estimation Using Facial Expressions
[Code](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)


Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can predict pain in subjects using facial expressions. The dataset used for this study was from The UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database. A facial coding system is used to encode facial expressions into the Prkachin & Solomon Pain Intensity Metric (PSPI score). This proposed architecture was inspired by the VGG16 architecture. The model was evaluated on a set of 200 images and an accuracy of 83% was achieved. It was deployed as a desktop application using the Tkinter library in Python.
